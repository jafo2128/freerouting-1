________________________________________________________

pdate da java on ya linux build.   Windows do ya java updates or head over to java.com and download a fresh java.. (Note not your average cup of mud/joe! just saying... )

from Oracle...  Grab the JRE (SE Runtime Java)Latest...   Worse case you may need JDK (SE Development Java)

For those Lunux folk you can also do this flavor.. Under linux CLI / Terminal session.. 
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre-headless

after that all said and done.. 

Head over to the other Git location: 
https://github.com/jafo2128/freerouting-1
 in the binaries folder... 
https://github.com/jafo2128/freerouting-1/tree/master/binaries

grab the java or executable file and away one goes.. !!

First make sure you export your KiCad board file as .dsn from FILE>EXPORT>Specctra DSN

Then run

java -jar FreeRouting.jar

Open you .dsn file and click Autorouter!  So they say.. (Reference taken from "http://psychoul.com/general/autoroute-pcbs-in-kicad-offline ")
